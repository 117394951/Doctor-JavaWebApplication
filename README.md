# Doctor Appliction created for University College Cork. 
# Project was to solve an organisational problem. UCC Doctor doesn't have any online services, all appointments must be created via a phone call. Impossible to get through to the busy phone line.
# Our application makes creating and handling appointments easy. Also with contact numbers and Doctor informations.
# Apart of a group project with Ali Olden, Molly Moran, Clare Nolan and Lauren Seery.
